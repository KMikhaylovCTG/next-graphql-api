During a meeting of eurogroup finance ministers on Thursday, Benoît Cœuré, a member of the European Central Bank’s board, speculated that Greek banks might not be able to open for business on Monday.  </p>\n<p>The European Central Bank has provided crucial, emergency funding to Greek banks that has sustained them in recent months. Yet as Greece’s finances continue to deteriorate, the ECB’s own rules may soon prevent it from extending further help, paving the way for a Greek exit from the eurozone.</p>\n<p>“The fate of Greek banks hinges on political developments, which will affect both their liquidity and their solvency,” said Jonas Floriani, an analyst at KBW Research.</p>\n<p>Analysts say Greek banks are vulnerable on three fronts.</p>\n<p>The first — and most immediate — is a liquidity shortage. This means banks’ ability to honour short-term withdrawals is worsening as consumers and companies take their cash elsewhere fearing a forced conversion of their savings into a new, less valuable currency.</p>\n<p>Domestic resident deposits have already fallen by roughly a fifth to just over €140bn in the six months to April, according to the latest Bank of Greece data, and analysts warn this trend has accelerated over the past six weeks.</p>\n<p>Deposit outflows hit €1bn on Thursday alone and about €3bn this week, according to two senior Athens-based bankers. </p>\n<p>As a result, Greek lenders are relying on <a href=\"/content/197a2706-ac93-11e4-beeb-00144feab7de\">ECB funding</a> and, in particular, its emergency liquidity assistance scheme, which they have tapped extensively as other sources of cash evaporate. </p>\n<a data-asset-type=\"video\" data-embedded=\"true\" href=\"http://video.ft.com/4307849118001\"></a>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://com.ft.imagepublish.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/8a5ad93c-16cb-11e5-b07f-00144feabdc0\" alt=\"\" longdesc=\"\" width=\"301\" height=\"322\" />Until mid-May, Greece’s four largest banks — National Bank of Greece, Alpha, Piraeus and Eurobank — borrowed more than €110bn from the ECB, including more than €75bn in ELA, according to estimates from KBW Research. </p>\n<p>The ECB on Wednesday raised its self-imposed limit on ELA by €1.1bn, to €84.1bn, and then approved another modest increase on Friday - although less than the €3bn Athens had requested. </p>\n<p>To qualify for emergency funding banks must be deemed solvent and also hold a sufficient quantity of high-quality securities to pledge as collateral.</p>\n<p>While analysts believe that Greek lenders still have sufficient assets to post to the central bank, there are worries over their longer-term solvency.</p>\n<promo-box><promo-title><p>FT View</p></promo-title><promo-headline><p><a href=\"/content/ab4be6da-15a0-11e5-8e6a-00144feabdc0\">Time for Tsipras to accept the deal from Europe</a>\n</p></promo-headline><promo-image><img src=\"http://com.ft.imagepublish.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/2a91c18e-14f8-11e5-9509-00144feabdc0\" alt=\"A Greek flag flutters by the hand of a statue of former British Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone in Athens June 17, 2015.

While Greece’s four largest lenders appear well capitalised — at least on paper — there are growing doubts about the quality of their assets, which stand to be severely damaged in the event of a government default.</p>\n<p>One weakness is their holdings of Greek government bonds. The four biggest banks hold nearly €15bn in such securities, whose value would take a significant hit in case of a missed payment to the IMF.</p>\n<p>A large portion of their capital is also comprised of so-called <a href=\"/content/222dc104-dc4b-11e4-b70d-00144feab7de\">deferred tax assets</a>, which allow banks to accumulate future tax credits from the government when they incur losses. In the case of Eurobank, DTAs are estimated to make up almost 90 per cent of the bank’s equity. For other large lenders, they account for about 50 per cent.</p>\n<p>“Reported capital levels look comfortable on a static basis, but the quality is more questionable and heavy DTA usage is worrying,” said Alicia Chung, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas.</p>\n<p>The ECB, which recently became the regulator of the eurozone’s largest banks, has already voiced concerns about DTAs. Any default would make these assets even harder to accept at face value. </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://com.ft.imagepublish.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/069b2bea-0fa2-11e5-b968-00144feabdc0\" alt=\"Chart: Greek bank deposits and eurosystems funding\" longdesc=\"\" width=\"301\" height=\"318\" />Finally, Greek banks are suffering from a progressive worsening of the economy, which has <a href=\"http://on.ft.com/1H2YijC\" title=\"Investors untroubled by Greek recession - fastFT - FT.com\">slipped back into recession</a> in the first quarter of this year after a tentative recovery in 2014.</p>\n<p>As conditions deteriorate and more consumers and businesses fall into arrears, the proportion of bad loans on the banks’ balance sheets is mounting. A default would only worsen this trend, making their capital position even shakier.</p>\n<p>“The prolonged uncertainty and long-lasting funding squeeze will probably put further pressure on the economy, resulting in . . . further asset quality issues,” said Margarita Streltses, an analyst at UBS.</p>\n<p>Were the ECB to deem Greek banks insolvent and suspend ELA, analysts believe the government would have no option but to impose <a href=\"/content/81051aae-0f79-11e5-b968-00144feabdc0\">capital controls</a>. </p>\n<p>Greece may then confront an ugly choice between “bailing in” depositors to recapitalise the banks, as Cyprus did in 2013, or start printing a new currency to provide lenders with fresh liquidity. </p>\n","summaries":["As anxious savers withdraw deposits, economists warn Greece’s lenders could collapse","Experts warn lenders could collapse as depositors withdraw money"],"publishedDate":"2015-06-19T12:13:39.000Z","webUrl":"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/265ceb78-15ae-11e5-8e6a-00144feabdc0.html","provenance":["http://api.ft.com/content/items/v1/265ceb78-15ae-11e5-8e6a-00144feabdc0","http://api.ft.com/enrichedcontent/265ceb78-15ae-11e5-8e6a-00144feabdc0"],"storyPackage":[{"id":"e19fab3a-1669-11e5-b07f-00144feabdc0","title":"ECB clears rise in emergency Greek loans"},{"id":"8651b708-1693-11e5-9883-00144feabdc0","title":"UK taxpayers face sizeable Grexit bill"},{"id":"81ba4342-165f-11e5-b07f-00144feabdc0","title":"Funds seek credit for Greek fallout"},{"id":"6e90b1d4-1687-11e5-b07f-00144feabdc0","title":"Greek talks yield bad blood but no deal"}],"byline":"Ferdinando Giugliano, Economics Correspondent","comments":{"enabled":true},"metadata":[{"idV1":"ZmEzMmRmNDAtNDc0Zi00ODk3LWE2ZmQtZWFmYzJlZTRjZTVk-VG9waWNz","prefLabel":"Greece Debt Crisis","taxonomy":"topics","primary":"theme","attributes":[]},{"idV1":"MTA4-U2VjdGlvbnM=","prefLabel":"EU Economy","taxonomy":"sections","primary":"section","attributes":[]},{"idV1":"Nw==-R2VucmVz","prefLabel":"News","taxonomy":"genre","attributes":[]},{"idV1":"ZjMwY2E2NjctMDA1Ni00ZTk4LWI0MWUtZjk5MTk2ZTMyNGVm-TWVkaWFUeXBlcw==","prefLabel":"Text","taxonomy":"mediaType","attributes":[]},{"idV1":"Q0ItMDAwMTc2MA==-QXV0aG9ycw==","prefLabel":"Ferdinando Giugliano","taxonomy":"authors","attributes":[]},{"idV1":"MTQy-SUNC","prefLabel":"8355 Banks","taxonomy":"icb","attributes":[]},{"idV1":"MDQwMDYwMDA=-SVBUQw==","prefLabel":"04006000 - financial and business service","taxonomy":"iptc","attributes":[]},{"idV1":"MDQwMDYwMDI=-SVBUQw==","prefLabel":"04006002 - banking","taxonomy":"iptc","attributes":[]},{"idV1":"MDQwMDgwMDE=-SVBUQw==","prefLabel":"04008001 - central bank","taxonomy":"iptc","attributes":[]},{"idV1":"MDQwMDgwMjA=-SVBUQw==","prefLabel":"04008020 - credit and debt","taxonomy":"iptc","attributes":[]},{"idV1":"MTEwMDYwMDk=-SVBUQw==","prefLabel":"11006009 - ministers (government)","taxonomy":"iptc","attributes":[]},{"idV1":"TnN0ZWluX09OX0FGVE1fT05fMTE2NTI2-T04=","prefLabel":"European Central Bank","taxonomy":"organisations","attributes":[{"key":"is_company","value":"false"}]},{"idV1":"TnN0ZWluX0dMX0dS-R0w=","prefLabel":"Greece","taxonomy":"regions","attributes":[]},{"idV1":"MTA3-U2VjdGlvbnM=","prefLabel":"World Economy","taxonomy":"sections","attributes":[{"key":"dfpSite","value":"world"},{"key":"dfpZone","value":"world.economy"}]},{"idV1":"MTA=-U2VjdGlvbnM=","prefLabel":"Brussels","taxonomy":"sections","attributes":[]},{"idV1":"NTc=-U2VjdGlvbnM=","prefLabel":"Financials","taxonomy":"sections","attributes":[{"key":"dfpSite","value":"companies"},{"key":"dfpZone","value":"financials"}]},{"idV1":"NTg=-U2VjdGlvbnM=","prefLabel":"Banks","taxonomy":"sections","attributes":[]},{"idV1":"OQ==-U2VjdGlvbnM=","prefLabel":"Europe","taxonomy":"sections","attributes":[{"key":"dfpSite","value":"world"},{"key":"dfpZone","value":"europe"}]},{"idV1":"MTE=-VG9waWNz","prefLabel":"European banks","taxonomy":"topics","attributes":[]}],"annotations":[{"idV2":"dcbcf483-e300-3f25-82f3-d4cbe96077bf","prefLabel":"National Bank of Greece SA","directType":"http://www.ft.com/ontology/company/PublicCompany","attributes":[]},{"idV2":"ce74210f-7b54-3e03-86c5-dfa1831de9aa","prefLabel":"International Monetary Fund","directType":"http://www.ft.com/ontology/organisation/Organisation","attributes":[]},{"idV2":"fca59f4d-d685-3c50-a02c-19149da20408","prefLabel":"Alicia M.
